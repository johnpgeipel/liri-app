# liri-app

**LIR**I stands for **Language Interpretaion and Recognition Interface**. With this project, we created a program that takes in user input, then retrieves and returns relevant results. The user can choose from four basic commands to initiate the search.
* spotify-this-song
* concert-this
* movie-this
* do-what-it-says

The user also enters either a **song title, musical artist or movie title**. The program then utilizes API databases from **Spotify, Bands in Town & OMDB** respectively.
